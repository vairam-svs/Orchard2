## Orchard CMS

Orchard is a free, [open source](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/Orchard), community-focused Content Management System built on the ASP.NET MVC platform.

## Status

### Pre-Alpha

The software is still under active development and not feature complete or ready for consumption by anyone other than software developers. There may be milestones during the pre-alpha which deliver specific sets of functionality, and nightly builds for other developers or users who are comfortable living on the absolute bleeding edge.

Here is a more detailed [roadmap](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/Orchard2/wiki/Roadmap).

## Getting Started

- Clone the repository using the command `git clone https://github.com/OrchardCMS/Orchard2.git` and checkout the `master` branch. 
- Delete `%LocalAppData%\Microsoft\dotnet` – The shared runtime dotnet installer doesn’t account for the old CLI structure.
- Delete `.build` (or run git clean -xdf) to get the latest KoreBuild
- Delete `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\NuGetPackages\dotnet-test-xunit`
- Run the `build.cmd` file included in the repository to dotnet CLI and build the solution.
- Next navigate to `D:\Orchard2\src\Orchard.Web` or where ever your retrospective folder is on the command line in Administrator mode.

### Using Kestrel

- Call `dotnet run`.
- Then open the `http://localhost:5000` URL in your browser.

### Using Console

- Call `dotnet run`.
- From here you can now execute commands in a similar fashion as before.
